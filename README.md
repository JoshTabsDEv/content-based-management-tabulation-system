# content-based-management-tabulation-system
For my final project in Web Programming 2, I created a Content-Based Management Tabulation System using Laravel. It enables dynamic management of judges, criteria, contestants, and events. Key features include user authentication, intuitive tabulation, search options, and a responsive design, enhancing usability and data organization.
